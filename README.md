# ai901coursedemos

Demos for my AI-901 course on Udemy. Each lesson has its own subdirectory with a `chatclient.py`, a `requirements.txt`, and a `config.env.example`. To run any demo:

1. `cd` into the lesson directory.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Copy `config.env.example` to `config.env` and fill in your values.
4. `python chatclient.py`

`config.env` is gitignored — your keys and endpoints stay local.

## [lesson4-2](lesson4-2/) — Chat client for a Foundry model

A simple interactive chat client that talks to a model deployed in Azure AI Foundry (e.g. DeepSeek-V3.2) via the OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint. The conversation history is kept locally and replayed on every turn, so the model sees the full context. Runs until you press Ctrl+C.

Config values: `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_FOUNDRY_API_KEY`, `AZURE_FOUNDRY_MODEL`, optional `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.

## [lesson4-4](lesson4-4/) — Chat client for a Foundry agent

Same interactive chat experience, but instead of calling a raw model it invokes a published Azure AI Foundry **agent** (with its instructions, tools, and personality baked in). Uses `azure-ai-projects` to resolve the agent by name + version, then the OpenAI Responses API with `agent_reference` and `previous_response_id` to maintain conversation state on the service side. Authenticates via `DefaultAzureCredential` (your `az login` session).

Config values: `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` (project endpoint), `AZURE_FOUNDRY_AGENT_NAME`, `AZURE_FOUNDRY_AGENT_VERSION`.

## [lesson5-1](lesson5-1/) — Text analytics: summarization, NER, key phrases

Runs a sample article through the Azure AI Language service using the `azure-ai-textanalytics` SDK and prints three results: an extractive summary, the named entities it found (with category and confidence), and the extracted key phrases. The script (`textanalytics.py`) is a single linear flow with no interactive prompt — meant as a readable reference for students. Authenticates with an endpoint + key.

Config values: `AZURE_LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_LANGUAGE_KEY`.

## [lesson5-3](lesson5-3/) — Live speech transcription

Captures audio from your default microphone and streams it to the Azure AI Foundry Speech service, printing both interim partial results and finalized phrases to the console in real time. Press Enter to stop.

Config values: `AZURE_SPEECH_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`.

## [lesson6-3](lesson6-3/) — Vision: object identification, detection, and OCR

A lightweight vision demo using the `azure-ai-vision-imageanalysis` SDK. The script (`vision.py`) reads three local images and runs one capability on each: `example1.png` is captioned and tagged to identify its main object, `example2.png` is run through object detection to list every object with its bounding-box coordinates, and `example3.png` is OCR'd to print the text it contains. Supply your own images with those filenames. Authenticates with an endpoint + key.

Config values: `AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_VISION_KEY`.

## [lesson7-4](lesson7-4/) — Content Understanding: information extraction

A lightweight information-extraction demo built on the `azure-ai-contentunderstanding` SDK (GA, service API version 2025-11-01). The script (`content_understanding.py`) sends three local files to prebuilt analyzers via `begin_analyze_binary`: `example1.pdf` and `example2.jpg` (both invoices) go through `prebuilt-invoice` and their extracted fields are printed, and `example3.mp3` (a recorded course lesson) goes through `prebuilt-callCenter` — it listens to the recording and prints a concise summary of what was discussed. The SDK handles the long-running submit-and-poll operation. Authenticates with an endpoint + key.

Config values: `AZURE_CONTENT_UNDERSTANDING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_CONTENT_UNDERSTANDING_KEY`.
